## What is Level 4 (TCP/IP) load balancer?



* Level 4 load balancing is typically used for applications that rely on the TCP and UDP protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, DNS, and FTP. The load balancer monitors the health and performance of the servers, and directs traffic to the most available and responsive server, which helps improve application availability, scalability, and performance.

* Compared to level 7 load balancers, which operate at the application layer and can make more sophisticated traffic routing decisions based on the content of the packets, level 4 load balancers are generally faster and less resource-intensive, but provide less granular control over traffic routing.
